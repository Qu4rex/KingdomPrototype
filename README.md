The enemy constantly follows the player's direction, but on his way there may be buildings (Archer Tower, spike tower, forge, mine), which he destroys on his way

You can buy upgrades from a bonfire:
1) Player speed
2) Player health
3) Spike damage
4) Archer damage

You can buy buildings at "building slot"
1) The mine adds +15 coins per second
2) The forge increases the maximum health of other buildings
3) A tower with spikes and archers deals damage to enemies
